# Class-Grade-Visualization
<h3>Data visualization for anonymized scores in POL214 summer session of 2020.</h3>
<h5>Code can be altered to make visualizations of your scores.</h5>
<p>R code produces graph comparing essay 1 score to midterm score among students with grades for both assignments. Code also produces a histogram of mean grade distribution. Very barebones code, nothing prettyâ€”just does the job.</p>

<p>To use your own scores, import your scoresheet as an .xlsx and follow instructions written in comment lines. This code was written to see how much of an
outlier my essay score was, when compared to my midterm score.</p>
